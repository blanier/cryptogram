### Active
- [ ] scrape http://www.brainyquote.com/
- [ ] more aggressive mulit-pass solving with backtracking

### observe
- [ ] explore odd character in today's dump ' --- looks like it was present all the way back to the XML.  wait for more.
- [ ] Duplicate puzzles are being presented

### Are these worth it?
- [ ] ALT-Tab/ALT-Shift-Tab to skip to next/prev unknown character
- [ ] overwrite mode for typing (type a letter, focus moves to the next letter)
- [ ] start characters
- [ ] end characters
- [ ] move URLs out to constants for easier mocking
- [ ] move puzzle generation to a service
- [ ] move key handling to global scope so focus doesn't matter as much
- [ ] explore other quote sources
- [ ] move common words out of JS - generalize suggestions engine to adapt to multiple sources
- [ ] add "BS" elimination mechanism for weird words in the list

### DONE
- [x] localStorage for key and cryptext
- [x] eliminate repeat showings of puzzles
- [x] shouldn't mistakenly adds a 1-letter word, 't.  fix me.
- [x] why is syntax highlighting broken for this file?
- [x] limit size of "seen" to something 
- [x] suggestions for 1, 2 and 3-character words
- [x] high-frequency letter
- [x] eliminate timeout loop on "next" button/better startup
- [x] eliminate trailing "DISCUSS" when found
- [x] clean up usage of localStorage - 
- [x] reload is broken after localStorage cleanup (key and hints aren't populating)
- [x] fix individual letter suggestion highlight
- [x] sometimes it seems like a puzzle is repeated.  Explore - change [master c6a6114]
- [X] hint?
- [X] new puzzle structure (simpler implementation REVISIT LATER) 
    - clear text (for hints)
    - key (for hints) (OPTED AGAINST THIS)
    - cryptext (for presentation)
    - original (for post-solution presentation)
- [x] correct completion indication/progress indicator
- [x] pare suggestions by regular expresstion matches (i.e. CVV -> TOO, SEE, etc.)
- [x] sort suggestions by consistency with current key settings
- [x] highlight hint letters that are consistent with current key settings
- [x] doubled letters (implicity with new winnowing mechanism)
- [x] get rid of the update cryptext grossness
- [x] page reload got broken.  key is not getting remembered anymore.
- [x] key has unnecessary entries after puzzle load.  it is ok after page load.
- [x] Add I to the word list
- [x] refactor hints by length to either a) eliminate unnecessary divs and make enough divs or b) sort by # of suggestions
- [x] fix 1-letter suggestions for new suggestion mechanism
- [x] indicate which letters have a value in the key when presenting a suggestion
- [x] undo/rollback feature
- [x] don't insert redundant characters in take-hint() 
      - repeated letters in hint word
      - letters already set in key (if they agree with the hint)
- [x] big hints are not generated on page reload (until a key change or puzzle load)
- [x] rethink suggestions service - to make it more watch()able and fix initial hint generation (nope, just $broadcast)
- [x] turn off highlighting when puzzle is complete
- [x] eliminate words that are all numbers
- [x] suggestion titles? -- Do I need to generalize suggestions a little more?
- [x] visually highlight words with 1 suggestion and missing letters -- INSTEAD: hide solved words
- [x] show unchosen letters somewhere (as hints for key focus, remove values already set in key)
- [x] get this shit in git/github
- [x] hide suggestion divs when they become empty
- [x] scrolling divs for suggestions
- [x] Hey... How about some tests
- [x] contractions
- [x] present words sorted by number of suggestions, not number of letters
- [x] attempt reload of puzzles every few hours
- [x] single-letter (A/I) collision with overall letter frequency.  Both divs appear when 1-letter-word is selected
- [x] auto-solve mode
- [x] directive to present cryptext and cleartext for a single character (stacked and side-by-side)
- [x] bootstrap.ui -- accordian integration
- [x] refactor presentation to use UI.bootstrap
- [x] add a method to choose common characters from suggestions.  e.g. if the suggestions are "they're" and "they've", then T, H, E and Y can all be set.
- [x] it's mistakenly adds a 3-letter word, its.  What should it do? Perhaps the contractions feature is enough.
- [x] remove suggestion limit support/address perf issue thus created
- [x] word ending in ! allows! into word
- [x] setup gh-pages branch
- [x] looks like there's a tabIndex bug.  Sometimes, the wrong div's have tabIndex=0. Explore.
      - seems to only happen after "next puzzle" from main UI or "->" from admin panel
      - refresh fixes it
      - transition through an empty cryptext "fixes" it
      - link function isn't called for all nodes
      - lat the digest cycle complete before setting cryptext to final value
- [x] "it is always one's virtues and not one's vices that precipitate one into disaster" auto-completes incorrectly - no it didn't - it was a byproduct of the key not getting cleared bug
- [x] key not getting cleared out on "Next Puzzle" - fixed
